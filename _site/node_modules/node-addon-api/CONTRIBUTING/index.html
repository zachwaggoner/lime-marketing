<h1><strong>node-addon-api</strong> Contribution Philosophy</h1>
<p>The <strong>node-addon-api</strong> team loves contributions. There are many ways in which you can
contribute to <strong>node-addon-api</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Source code fixes</li>
<li>Additional tests</li>
<li>Documentation improvements</li>
<li>Joining the N-API working group and participating in meetings</li>
</ul>
<h2>Source changes</h2>
<p><strong>node-addon-api</strong> is meant to be a thin convenience wrapper around N-API. With this
in mind, contributions of any new APIs that wrap around a core N-API API will
be considered for merge. However, changes that wrap existing <strong>node-addon-api</strong>
APIs are encouraged to instead be provided as an ecosystem module. The
<strong>node-addon-api</strong> team is happy to link to a curated set of modules that build on
top of <strong>node-addon-api</strong> if they have broad usefulness to the community and promote
a recommended idiom or pattern.</p>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>The N-API team considered a couple different approaches with regards to changes
extending <strong>node-addon-api</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Larger core module - Incorporate these helpers and patterns into <strong>node-addon-api</strong></li>
<li>Extras package - Create a new package (strawman name '<strong>node-addon-api</strong>-extras')
that contain utility classes and methods that help promote good patterns and
idioms while writing native addons with <strong>node-addon-api</strong>.</li>
<li>Ecosystem - Encourage creation of a module ecosystem around <strong>node-addon-api</strong>
where folks can build on top of it.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Larger Core</h4>
<p>This is probably our simplest option in terms of immediate action needed. It
would involve landing any open PRs against <strong>node-addon-api</strong>, and continuing to
encourage folks to make PRs for utility helpers against the same repository.</p>
<p>The downside of the approach is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less coherency for our API set</li>
<li>More maintenance burden on the N-API WG core team.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Extras Package</h4>
<p>This involves us spinning up a new package which contains the utility classes
and methods. This has the benefit of having a separate module where helpers
which make it easier to implement certain patterns and idioms for native addons
easier.</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potential for confusion - we'll need to provide clear documentation to help the
community understand where a particular contribution should be directed to (what
belongs in <strong>node-addon-api</strong> vs <strong>node-addon-api-extras</strong>)</li>
<li>Need to define the level of support/API guarantees</li>
<li>Unclear if the maintenance burden on the N-API WG is reduced or not</li>
</ul>
<h4>Ecosystem</h4>
<p>This doesn't require a ton of up-front work from the N-API WG. Instead of
accepting utility PRs into <strong>node-addon-api</strong> or creating and maintaining a new
module, the WG will encourage the creation of an ecosystem of modules that
build on top of <strong>node-addon-api</strong>, and provide some level of advertising for these
modules (listing them out on the repository/wiki, using them in workshops/tutorials
etc).</p>
<p>The downside of this approach is the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Potential for lack of visibility - evangelism and education is hard, and module
authors might not find right patterns and instead implement things themselves</li>
<li>There might be greater friction for the N-API WG in evolving APIs since the
ecosystem would have taken dependencies on the API shape of <strong>node-addon-api</strong></li>
</ul>
