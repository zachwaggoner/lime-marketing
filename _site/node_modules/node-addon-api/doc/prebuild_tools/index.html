<h1>Prebuild tools</h1>
<p>The distribution of a native add-on is just as important as its implementation.
In order to install a native add-on it's important to have all the necessary
dependencies installed and well configured (see the <a href="setup.md">setup</a> section).
The end-user will need to compile the add-on when they will do an <code>npm install</code>
and in some cases this could create problems. To avoid the compilation process it's
possible to distribute the native add-on in pre-built form for different platform
and architectures. The prebuild tools help to create and distribute the pre-built
form of a native add-on.</p>
