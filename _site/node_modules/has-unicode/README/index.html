<h1>has-unicode</h1>
<p>Try to guess if your terminal supports unicode</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var hasUnicode = require(&quot;has-unicode&quot;)

if (hasUnicode()) {
  // the terminal probably has unicode support
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var hasUnicode = require(&quot;has-unicode&quot;).tryHarder
hasUnicode(function(unicodeSupported) {
  if (unicodeSupported) {
    // the terminal probably has unicode support
  }
})
</code></pre>
<h2>Detecting Unicode</h2>
<p>What we actually detect is UTF-8 support, as that's what Node itself supports.
If you have a UTF-16 locale then you won't be detected as unicode capable.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
<p>Since at least Windows 7, <code>cmd</code> and <code>powershell</code> have been unicode capable,
but unfortunately even then it's not guaranteed. In many localizations it
still uses legacy code pages and there's no facility short of running
programs or linking C++ that will let us detect this. As such, we
report any Windows installation as NOT unicode capable, and recommend
that you encourage your users to override this via config.</p>
<h3>Unix Like Operating Systems</h3>
<p>We look at the environment variables <code>LC_ALL</code>, <code>LC_CTYPE</code>, and <code>LANG</code> in
that order.  For <code>LC_ALL</code> and <code>LANG</code>, it looks for <code>.UTF-8</code> in the value.
For <code>LC_CTYPE</code> it looks to see if the value is <code>UTF-8</code>.  This is sufficient
for most POSIX systems.  While locale data can be put in <code>/etc/locale.conf</code>
as well, AFAIK it's always copied into the environment.</p>
