<p>A set of utilities to assist developers of tools that build <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_n_api">N-API</a> native add-ons.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>This module is targeted to developers creating tools that build N-API native add-ons.</p>
<p>It implements a set of functions that aid in determining the N-API version supported by the currently running Node instance and the set of N-API versions against which the N-API native add-on is designed to be built. Other functions determine whether a particular N-API version can be built and can issue console warnings for unsupported N-API versions.</p>
<p>Unlike the modules this code is designed to facilitate building, this module is written entirely in JavaScript.</p>
<h2>Quick start</h2>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ npm install napi-build-utils
</code></pre>
<p>The module exports a set of functions documented <a href="./index.md">here</a>. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">var napiBuildUtils = require('napi-build-utils');
var napiVersion = napiBuildUtils.getNapiVersion(); // N-API version supported by Node, or undefined.
</code></pre>
<h2>Declaring supported N-API versions</h2>
<p>Native modules that are designed to work with <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html#n_api_n_api">N-API</a> must explicitly declare the N-API version(s) against which they are coded to build. This is accomplished by including a <code>binary.napi_versions</code> property in the module's <code>package.json</code> file. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">&quot;binary&quot;: {
  &quot;napi_versions&quot;: [2,3]
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the absence of a need to compile against a specific N-API version, the value <code>3</code> is a good choice as this is the N-API version that was supported when N-API left experimental status.</p>
<p>Modules that are built against a specific N-API version will continue to operate indefinitely, even as later versions of N-API are introduced.</p>
